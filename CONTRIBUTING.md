### Submitting an Issue

Before submitting your issue, please check that it has not been reported already (open or closed).
Please provide as many details as possible so we can act immediately.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before submitting a pull request, consider the following guidelines:

1. To prevent duplication of work, please search for an existing PR (open or closed) that relates to yours.
2. Make sure there is an issue describing your submission, whether it is a bug fix or a feature. Discussing the issue upfront will make the review process much faster.
3. Make sure your pull request is addressing only a single concern.
 
 **How to submit a pull request?**

1. Fork the relevant repository.
2. Check out a topic branch for your submission.
3. Apply your work there. It's fine to have multiple commits. We will make sure to squash it before merging.
4. Make sure to add appropriate tests which cover your work.
6. Run the test suite of the repository.
7. Push your new branch to GitHub.
8. Submit a pull request to the master branch.

Once everything is done, your work will be live and available to all Howdy users.
