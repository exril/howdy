# Contributing to Howdy


## Code of Conduct
We have some ground rules to keep the discussion open and inclusive.
Please take your time to read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT).

## Where to Contribute?


## Found a Bug?
If you find a bug (sorry for that :sweat_smile:), you can contribute by [submitting an issue][submit-issue].
If you are really into it, [submit a Pull Request][submit-pr] with your fix, we will be grateful forever.

## Documentation Never Ends
When it comes to documentation, there is always room for improvement.
You can feel free to [submit a Pull Request][submit-pr] with your documentation changes or even just [submit an issue][submit-issue].

## Have a Great Idea?
Feel like you know what feature is missing? Share your thoughts with us by [submitting an issue][submit-issue].
Do you want to make sure your feature is implemented? Submit an issue with your implementation proposal.
This will allow us to prevent duplication of work, discuss the details of the implementation, and even provide designs, if necessary.
Discussing your proposal will make sure that your work will be accepted into the project.

## Contribution Guideline

### Submitting an Issue

Before submitting your issue, please check that it has not been reported already (open or closed).
Please provide as many details as possible so we can act as soon as possible.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before submitting a pull request, consider the following guidelines:

1. To prevent duplication of work, please search for an existing PR (open or closed) that relates to yours.
2. Make sure there is an issue describing your submission, whether it is a bug fix or a feature. Discussing the issue upfront will make the review process much faster.
3. Make sure your pull request is addressing only a single concern.
 
 **How to submit a pull request?**

1. Fork the relevant repository.
2. Check out a topic branch for your submission.
3. Apply your work there. It's fine to have multiple commits. We will make sure to squash it before merging.
4. Make sure to add appropriate tests which cover your work.
6. Run the test suite of the repository.
7. Push your new branch to GitHub.
8. Submit a pull request to the master branch.

Once everything is done, your work will be live and available to all Howdy users.

## Coding Rules
