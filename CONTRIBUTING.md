# Contributing to Howdy

We're thrilled you're interested in contributing to Howdy! 
This guide will help you understand how to effectively contribute, whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting an improvement, or submitting code changes.

## Code of Conduct

We have some ground rules to keep the discussion open and inclusive.
Before diving in, be sure to review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a respectful and collaborative environment.

## Contribution Guideline

### Found a Bug?

**Check for Existing Issues:** Search the existing issues list to see if someone has already reported the bug.
**Open a New Issue:** If you can't find an existing issue, create a new one with a clear and descriptive title. [Submitting an Issue](https://github.com/intelagense/howdy/issues)

**How to submit an issue?**

1. **Navigate to the repository's issue list:** First, find the open-source project on GitHub. Then, under the repository name, click on "Issues".
2. **Initiate a new issue:**  On the issues page, locate a button labeled "New issue" or something similar. Click on it to begin creating a new issue report.
3. **Craft a clear and concise title:** Provide a simple and informative title that accurately reflects the issue you're encountering. The title should give maintainers a quick understanding of the problem.
4. **Describe the issue thoroughly:**  In the issue description, provide a detailed explanation of the problem you've encountered. Here are some pointers for a comprehensive description:
     - Steps to reproduce: Outline the exact steps required to replicate the issue. This allows maintainers to efficiently diagnose the problem.
     - Expected vs. actual behavior: Describe what you anticipated to happen and what occurred.
     - Code snippets and error messages (if applicable): If the issue is related to code, include relevant code snippets and any error messages encountered.
     - Screenshots or screencasts (if helpful): For visual issues, screenshots or screencasts can significantly aid understanding.
9. **Double-check and submit:**  Once you've meticulously described the issue, proofread your report for clarity and accuracy. When satisfied, submit the issue.

### Documentation Never Ends [Suggesting Enhancements]

When it comes to documentation, there is always room for improvement.
- **Consider Creating an Issue:** If your enhancement is a major change, feel free to open an issue to discuss it with the project maintainers. [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/intelagense/howdy/pulls)
- **Open a Pull Request:** For smaller improvements or suggestions, you can create a pull request directly. [submit an Issue](https://github.com/intelagense/howdy/issues)

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before submitting a pull request, consider the following guidelines:

- To prevent duplication of work, please search for an existing PR (open or closed) that relates to yours.
- Make sure there is an issue describing your submission, whether it is a bug fix or a feature. Discussing the issue upfront will make the review process much faster.
- Make sure your pull request is addressing only a single concern.
 
 **How to submit a pull request?**

1. Fork the relevant repository.
2. Check out a topic branch for your submission.
3. Apply your work there. It's fine to have multiple commits. We will make sure to squash it before merging.
4. Make sure to add appropriate tests which cover your work.
6. Run the test suite of the repository.
7. Push your new branch to GitHub.
8. Submit a pull request to the master branch.

Once everything is done, your work will be live and available to all Howdy users.

## Coding Standards

Each repository has its own coding rules and formatters to enforce them when running the tests automatically.
To ensure consistency and readability, we use [PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for most Python projects.

### Commit Messages

We follow [Angular's commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format). This leads to more readable messages and automatic changelog generation.

**ðŸ¤  Thank you for joining our journey! We appreciate your time and effort in making Howdy even better.**
